A few ideas which come across my mind are:\r\n\r\n1. Using the 'following' data (people who the user follows) to understand user's taste and give suggestions on basis of that.\r\n2. Reducing the number of API calls (using something like Redis and GitHub conditional API requests).\r\n3. Using much more smarter keyword extraction tool from the phrase built from user's profile.\r\n\r\nI would be more than happy to know any kind of suggestions which could improve the model further.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nAs I said, there is a lot of scope of improvement, both from an angle of design as well as implementation.\r\n\r\nAny kind of contribution (through a pull-request), small or big, is whole heartedly welcome.\r\n\r\n##Credits\r\n\r\n1. Thanks to [mdo/github-buttons](https://github.com/mdo/github-buttons) from which github buttons CSS is copied. (I would directly use the iframe but that would have incurred an API call)\r\n2. Thanks to [ashleyw/phrasie](https://github.com/ashleyw/phrasie/) which i have used as a gem for keyword extraction from a phrase.\r\n3. Finally, to [octokit/octokit.rb](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb) which is written so cleanly and beautifully.\r\n","google":"UA-46845526-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
